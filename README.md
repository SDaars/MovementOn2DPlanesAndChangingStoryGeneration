# MovementOn2DPlanesAndChangingStoryGeneration
A test on random generation with locally stored txt files and creating partially random story generations - output is randomly chosen from a group of items that are grouped in type. For example, if the randomly generated terrain is a mountain, then there will be a random story from a group of stories that are applicable to that terrain.

This is a small application made in order to learn more about files and streams, as well as to serve as an experiment to get better at file organisation. It is the framework of a game, and will or does include things like a randomly generated game board, movement on the board, stories generated according to where on the board you are, inventory, and later on perhaps a system to handle interactions and quests.

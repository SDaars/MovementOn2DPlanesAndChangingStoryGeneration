# MovementOn2DPlanesAndChangingStoryGeneration
A test on random generation with locally stored txt files and creating partially random story generations - output is randomly chosen from a group of items that are grouped in type. For example, if the randomly generated terrain is a mountain, then there will be a random story from a group of stories that are applicable to that terrain.

This is a small console application made in order to learn more about files and streams, as well as to serve as an experiment to get better at file organisation. It is a simple framework to a console text-based game. The project is sufficiently polished and the intended purpose of learning file management has been completed, and so no future updates are planned.

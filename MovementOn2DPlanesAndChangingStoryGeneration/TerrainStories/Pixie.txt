A"What a weird place, you think to yourself. At a glance it seemed normal - there were trees, grass, some animals moving about - but when you looked closer, things were obviously off. The wood was a deep shade of pink, and the grass was tinged purple. The most odd, however, were the creatures. Humanoid figures with wings like that of a dragonfly, giant lizards in the sky, also with wings, and walking boulders, those ones missing out on the wings."
A"A pixie fluttered around above the small lake. During its pirouettes, it spotted you watching. As if embarrassed, it froze for a moment, then flew away into the surrounding forest."
A"The size of the beast was abnormal. You watched the big lizard from the security of the trees. It was currently drinking at the lake you had put your camp near. It began to sniff the air, and with a sudden jerk, it turned its head straight towards you. With a few flaps of its mighty wings, it was gone."
A"The pixies seemed to be watching you today. They didn't seem to realise that they glowed, and so were obvious even when in the trees. As long as they didn't attack him, it was fine."
A"You woke up to a scratching outside your tent. Fearing to make noise, you stay silent. Soon, the scratching grew faint, until gone. Nevertheless, it had frightened you half to death, and you couldn't sleep that night."
